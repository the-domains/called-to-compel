<p>If you look to your left or right on any given Sunday morning at Church, you will likely see rows of men and women who belong to Jesus. At some point through the years, you will likely have read the verse or heard a song about there being no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. And that is super news for us and for the Christians around us. We will not be condemned by God because of the loving substitutional sacrifice of his Son! But have you ever considered the implications that verse has for those who are not in Christ?</p><p>Often, as Christians, we read scripture through the eyes of a secured soul. Meaning, when we read John 3:18 the emphasis we come away with is whoever believes in Jesus is not condemned. Which is absolutely true and certainly applies to those who have been born again. But what we usually miss is that whoever does NOT believe in Jesus is condemned already.</p><p> Again in John 3:36 we understand the assurance of our salvation because whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. But have we accepted the fact that whoever does NOT obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him? It may be surprising for some to realize that in the same breath Jesus uses to comfort the saved, he also warns the rebellious of their impending judgment.</p><p>Our culture has become very sensitive. We like to avoid confrontation and exclusion. We don’t want to be the person who tells sinners the truth about Hell. It’s uncomfortable. So many christians have decided to tell people that a loving God wouldn’t be mad at them. That he wouldn’t condemn them. But that’s a lie.</p><p>“Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.” - John 3:18</p><p>“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” - John 3:36 </p><p>These passages have no need to be explained. They are as self evident as they come. If a person does not believe in Jesus, he remains condemned. If someone does not obey Jesus, the punishment of God will not be removed from them.</p><p>So while we who are saved enjoy the warmth of our eternal security, we must acknowledge there are people around us every week at work, at the gym, at Starbucks who this security does not belong to. Next time you hear the sweet sound of the assurance of your salvation, look to your right and left and consider the many who are not hearing that same song. This might be the right time to start telling them all you know about the salvation that is found only in Jesus the Messiah.</p><picture>
